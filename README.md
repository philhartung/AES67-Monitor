# AES67 Stream Monitor
Cross plattform AES67 monitoring app. The app was primarily tested in a hybrid Dante/AES67 environment. Features include:
 * Auto discovery of streams via Session Announcement Protocol and manually adding streams by pasting SDP data
 * Filter and sort streams
 * listen to streams by selecting which channels you want to listen to (Stereo and Mono supported)
 * wide format support: 44100Hz, 48000Hz and 96000Hz (and more) if the soundcard supports it, L16 and L24 PCM with up to 64 channels and all packet times according to AES67 spec are supported
 * Settings for Network interface, audio device, buffering for RTP and more

Here are some screenshots of how the app looks:

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/philhartung/aes67-monitor.git
cd aes67-monitor
npm install
```
The app should then be installed.  Audify (audio backend used) prebuilds are available for most major platforms and Node versions. If you need to build Audify from source, see https://github.com/almogh52/audify#requirements-for-source-build.

After installation you can start the app with `npm start`.

## Building
To build a binary for your system, first install the app and then run:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a folder for your platform and CPU architecture, containing the binary.

## Status
This app is still in early development. Some things that need to be reworked before a more stable release include, but are not limited to:
 * ~~rewrite RTP audio backend to support more audio formats (it is currently limited to 48000Hz L24 at 48 samples/packet and quite buggy, also add the option for buffering)~~ done
 * ~~rewrite SDP module and SAP backend~~ done
 * ~~proper support for settings~~ done
 * make settings persistent between restarts
 * needs a lot more testing
 
 Also I would like to add more features such as:
  * dBFS and LUFS metering
  * ~~possibility to add streams from raw sdp~~ done
  * RTP packet monitoring (like seqnum, timestamp, etc)
  * ~~make the table sortable~~ done
